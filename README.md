##  About 
This is a College Subject project developed using PHP in order to create a client-server architecture. The topic selected was a personal decision: 1987 NASCAR season. Involves a back-end web server feauturing central routing according several endpoints(pretty url), register and login management, different views for different roles, posting a comment and granting points. Some other features includes advanced filtering and sorting. Most of content uses server side rendering, though comments involves client side rendering. Basic front-end using Bootstrap (for a bit of style) and Smarty templates. In this subject, front-end wasn't the goal, so that's why the simplicity of it.
